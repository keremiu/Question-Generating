Which of the following statements correctly defines a function in Python?,,"A correct definition of a function in Python is: 

""A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It takes in input values (called arguments), performs operations on them, and returns a result. Functions allow for code reusability, modularity, and abstraction.""",Functions,Function definition and calling
Which of the following best describes a parameter in Python?,,"A parameter in Python can be best described as a variable that is passed into a function or method when it is called, and is used to represent either an input or output value for that function or method.",Functions,Parameters and return values
Which of the following is a valid usage of an anonymous function (lambda) in Python?,,"One valid usage of an anonymous function (lambda) in Python is to use it as an argument in a higher-order function like map(), filter(), or reduce(). For example:

1. Using lambda with map():
   ```
   nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   squares = map(lambda x: x**2, nums)
   ```
   This will create a new list containing the squares of each element in the nums list.

2. Using lambda with filter():
   ```
   nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   even_nums = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums)
   ```
   This will create a new list containing only the even numbers from the nums list.

3. Using lambda with reduce():
   ```
   from functools import reduce
   nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, nums)
   ```
   This will calculate the product of all the numbers in the nums list.

These are just a few examples of valid usages of anonymous functions in Python. The lambda function allows you to define a simple function inline, without the need for a separate function definition.",Functions,Anonymous functions (lambda)
Which of the following statements is true about local and global variables in Python?,,"The correct answer is that local variables are defined within a specific function or block of code, while global variables are defined outside of any function and can be accessed throughout the entire program.",Functions,Local and global variables

Which of the following methods can be used to remove an item from a dictionary?,,"To remove an item from a dictionary in Python, you can use the `del` keyword, `dict.pop()`, or `dict.popitem()` methods. Here are the options:

1. Using the `del` keyword:
   ```
   del dict[key]
   ```

2. Using the `dict.pop()` method:
   ```
   dict.pop(key)
   ```

3. Using the `dict.popitem()` method:
   ```
   dict.popitem()
   ```

These methods allow you to remove items from a dictionary based on a specific key (`del` and `dict.pop()`) or to remove the last item inserted (`dict.popitem()`).",Data Structures,Dictionaries

It allows different objects to be treated as if they are instances of a common superclass, enabling code reuse and flexibility.",Object Oriented Programming (OOP),Polymorphism
Which of the following correctly defines encapsulation in Python?,,"Encapsulation in Python is the concept of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. This allows for data hiding and abstraction by restricting access to the internal workings of the object and exposing only the necessary interface.",Object Oriented Programming (OOP),Encapsulation
Which of the following statements is true about try-except blocks in Python?,,"The correct answer is: 

Try-except blocks in Python are used for handling exceptions. They allow you to catch and handle errors that may occur during the execution of your code.

Which of the following is NOT a built-in type of exception in Python?,,"The correct answer is ""KeyError"". ""KeyError"" is an exception raised when an invalid key is used to access a dictionary. It is not considered to be a built-in type of exception in Python.",Exception Handling,Types of exceptions
What is the purpose of defining your own exceptions in Python?,,"The purpose of defining your own exceptions in Python is to handle specific errors or exceptional situations in your program. By defining custom exceptions, you can make your code more readable, maintainable, and expressive. It allows you to create exception classes tailored to your specific needs, and provide meaningfully distinct error messages or behavior for different types of exceptions. This can help with debugging and troubleshooting, as well as improving the overall robustness and reliability of your code.",Exception Handling,Defining your own exceptions
